# Gym Membership and Class Booking System

The Gym Membership and Class Booking System is a web application developed to simplify the management of gym memberships and class scheduling. It allows for online registration of membership, access to class availability, and hence early booking. The system provides users with the ability to monitor their bookings, descriptions of the classes, and manage their attendance; this therefore makes life easier for the users. On the administrative side, gym managers can create and schedule classes, monitor attendance, limit class size, and manage member profiles. It can process membership payments and renewals and send notifications to users about class reminders or membership status. By integrating these functionalities into a system, it takes the whole gym experience to a different level altogether, where members can show more engagement and gyms are able to manage efficiently.
