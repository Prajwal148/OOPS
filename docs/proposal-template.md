## Introduction

The project **"Gym Membership and Class Booking System"** is a web-based application that aims to alleviate the burden of managing gym memberships and class scheduling. Users will be able to enroll in memberships, check class availability, book them in advance, and track their attendance. This system enhances member engagement by sending notifications regarding class enrollments and updates on membership status.

On the administrative side, the system includes features such as class creation and scheduling, managing class size, tracking attendance, and member profile management. It also handles membership sales and renewals, streamlining payments and helping gyms optimize resources by automating parts of their business.

The system aims to deliver a seamless experience for both members and administrators, leading to better gyms with higher engagement.

## Anticipated Technologies

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for managing user data, class schedules, and memberships
- **Payment Integration**: PayPal API for handling online payments and renewals
- **Notifications**: Twilio for sending automated notifications
- **Hosting/Cloud Services**: AWS for deploying and scaling the application

## Method/Approach

- **Requirements Gathering and Design**: Team meetings to gather detailed requirements for the user interface and system architecture.
- **Frontend Development**: Build a user-friendly and responsive interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Backend Development**: Implement server-side logic using Node.js, with PostgreSQL for data storage to manage user signups, bookings, and class management.
- **Database Integration**: Connect the application with PostgreSQL for storing user profiles, class schedules, and payment information.
- **Notification and Payment Gateway Integration**: Use PayPal for payment processing and Twilio/Firebase for sending notifications.
- **Testing and Deployment**: Perform unit and system testing, and deploy the system on AWS, integrating both front-end and back-end with the database.

## Estimated Timeline

- **Week 1-2**: Requirements gathering and system design
- **Week 3-5**: Frontend development 
- **Week 6-8**: Backend development and database setup
- **Week 9**: Payment gateway and notification system integration
- **Week 10**: Testing, debugging, and system deployment

## Anticipated Problems

- **Integration of Payment Systems**: Seamless integration of different payment systems may be challenging, requiring tuning with security protocols.
- **Notification System**: This requires careful configuration and monitoring to ensure timely and accurate delivery of reminders and updates regarding classes and memberships.
