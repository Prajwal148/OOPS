## Discussion Points:  
- **Frontend-Backend Integration**: Prajwal and Guru worked together to integrate the frontend with the backend. Data such as class schedules, membership status, and payment details are now dynamically displayed on the frontend.  
- **SQLite Database Reports**: Guru successfully added a report generation feature that provides detailed user and class reports. Testing for data accuracy is in progress.  
- **Payment System Updates**: Hari completed the implementation of the **custom payment system** and began testing it with sample transactions.  

## Challenges:  
- Minor synchronization issues between real-time updates on the frontend and SQLite database changes.  
- Testing of the custom payment solution needs further refinement.

## Goals for Next Week:  
- **Prajwal Garla**: Finalize dynamic data integration on the frontend and ensure all components update in real-time.  
- **Mahesh Peta**: Assist with payment integration and ensure smooth database interactions with SQLite.  
- **Guru Saran Reddy BusiReddy**: Resolve minor data synchronization issues and test the report generation feature under real-world conditions.  
- **Hari Naga Venkata Sai Posani**: Refine the custom payment solution and complete the transaction flow testing.
